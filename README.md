## Project Description:
   While thinking about the challenges we face learning how to code, or learning how to 3D model, or how to garden, or doing any project/assignment, one problem stood out: Following through with our projects. 
   As anyone who has competed in a hackathon like this one knows, we can make a lot of progress on an application in 36 hours, but afterwards we lose a lot of motivation to complete the project. This is true in all walks of life, and others have difficulty starting projects in the first place. 
   To help people begin and finish their learning journeys, we wanted to create a product that implements a user-focused implementation of a SMART Goal. A SMART Goal stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, And Timely. It can be confusing to organize groups of tasks into this format, and even harder for a whole project. Followthru helps you create SMART goals without even knowing it through our user interface for project management. 
   Our goal is to implement each of the letters in the SMART acronyms with a service in our application. 
   * S: 
Solution, Goal, Problems

We have problems and see others have problems with either starting or finishing projects.
