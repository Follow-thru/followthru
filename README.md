## Project Description 📝: 
To help people begin their learning journey, and to make sure they see it through to the end, we wanted to create a product that implements a user-focused interface of a SMART Goal. A SMART Goal stands for Specific, Measurable, Attainable, Realistic, And Timely. They have been proven to help motivate people to accomplish more.

However, it can be confusing to organize groups of tasks into this format, and even harder for a whole project. **Followthru** helps you create SMART goals without even knowing it through our user interface for project management. 
   
    Our goal is to implement each of the letters in the SMART acronyms with a service in our application. 
* S: *Specific* 🎯
    * Creating modular project organization
    * Branching off related groups into smaller pieces
* M: *Measurable* 📏
    * To-do Lists
    * See your progress with contribution graphs 
    *Time-lines for the future
* A: *Attainable* ⛳️
    * Selecting priorities allows more thought into goals
    * Modularity helps to see steps necessary
* R: *Relevant* 👤
    * Dedicated page for help creating goals
    * Online video and written tutorials
    * High quality information about motivation and goal theories
* T: *Time-Bound* ⏳
    * Due dates allow for thought about timelines
    * Push notifications make sure users stay on top of things
    * Priority of timelines gives more flexibility than other services

## Inspiration 💡:
While thinking about the challenges we face learning how to code, or learning how to 3D model, or how to garden, or doing any project/assignment, one problem stood out: Following through with our projects. 
    
As anyone who has competed in a hackathon like this one knows, we can make a lot of progress on an application in 36 hours, but afterwards we lose a lot of motivation to complete the project. This is true in all walks of life, and others have difficulty starting projects in the first place. 

Combining our team's many ideas together, of to-do apps, learning resources, help with exam fever, organization software, and more, we came up with the name Followthru, and the rest evolved from that.
