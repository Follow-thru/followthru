## Project Description:
While thinking about the challenges we face learning how to code, or learning how to 3D model, or how to garden, one problem stood out: Following through with our projects. As anyone who has competed in a hackathon like this one knows, we can make an application in 36 hours, but then take a week to work on it again.
